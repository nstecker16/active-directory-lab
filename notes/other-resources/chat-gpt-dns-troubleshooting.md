# Chat GPT dialogue: DNS troubleshooting

## Prompt: 

The DNS server is waiting for Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to signal that the initial synchronization of the directory has been completed

## Response:

That message usually shows up when youâ€™ve just set up a **new domain controller with DNS** and restarted services. It means the DNS service is running but wonâ€™t start responding to queries yet because itâ€™s waiting for **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) replication and initial synchronization** to complete.

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going on and how to address it:

---

### Why it happens

* A DNS server that is also a **domain controller** relies on AD DS for its zones (AD-integrated zones).
* When the DC first starts, AD DS has to **synchronize its directory data with replication partners**.
* Until synchronization is confirmed, DNS wonâ€™t serve dataâ€”this is a safeguard to prevent outdated or incomplete DNS records from being used.

---

### Things to check

1. **Is this the first domain controller in the forest?**

   * If yes: It doesnâ€™t need to replicate with others, so synchronization will complete once AD is fully up. DNS should then start normally.
   * If no: It must replicate from a partner DC before DNS will be fully functional.

2. **Run `dcdiag` and `repadmin` tools**

   * `dcdiag /test:dns` â†’ check DNS health.
   * `repadmin /replsummary` â†’ check replication status.

3. **Event Viewer**

   * Look in **Directory Service** and **DNS Server** logs for errors.
   * Often youâ€™ll see warnings about replication delays or inability to contact replication partners.

4. **Force replication**

   * `repadmin /syncall /AdeP` â†’ forces replication of all partitions.

5. **Network and firewall**

   * Make sure this DC can reach its replication partners (ports 135, 389, 445, 3268, and high RPC ports must be open).

---

### Common scenarios

* **Brand new forest/domain**: Wait a few minutes for AD DS to finish initializing. DNS should come up.
* **Additional DC**: Ensure it can contact an existing DC and replicate AD-integrated DNS zones.
* **Stuck state**: If replication is broken, DNS will remain in this waiting mode until fixed.

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™d like, I can walk you through step-by-step commands to test whether replication is the issue or if DNS just needs more time.

Do you know if this server is the **first DC in the domain** or an **additional one** you just set up?
